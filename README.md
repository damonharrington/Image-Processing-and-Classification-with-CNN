# Image-Processing-and-Classification-with-CNN
Building an CNN model for Satellite Image Prediction Using Image Processing techniques


1.1 Application Domain:
This project focuses on classifying satellite images into four classes: cloudy, desert, green area, and water. Satellite imagery is crucial for environmental monitoring, agricultural assessment, weather forecasting, and land-use analysis. These tasks are essential in managing resources, monitoring climate change, and enhancing disaster management.

1.2 Why Image Processing is Required:
In remote sensing and satellite imagery analysis, the quality and size of the images are significant factors affecting storage, processing, and transmission costs. Image compression techniques, such as lossy (JPEG) and lossless (PNG), help reduce image sizes without compromising critical information. By assessing the impact of image compression on classification accuracy, we can determine the feasibility of using compressed images in satellite image analysis, thereby optimizing resources.

1.3 About the Dataset:
The dataset contains images from four categories:
- Cloudy

   - Lossy Compression (JPEG with specified quality).
   - Lossless Compression (PNG format).

3.3 Model Definition:
v. Define a CNN model with:
   - Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
   - Max-pooling layers for downsampling.
   - Dropout and dense layers for classification.

3.4 Model Training:
vi. Train the CNN model separately on:
   - Uncompressed images.
   - Lossy compressed images.
   - Lossless compressed images.

3.5 Evaluation and Comparison:
vii. Evaluate model accuracy on each dataset.
viii. Compare the accuracy and interpret the effect of compression.


4. Interpretation of Results:

The improvements seen with lossy and lossless compression reflect the impact of preprocessing choices on CNN performance:

i. Noise Reduction: Compression, particularly lossy compression, can reduce high-frequency noise in images. This can enhance the clarity of the most relevant patterns, aiding the CNN in learning more stable and generalized representations of each class. Noise reduction also helps avoid overfitting, as the model can focus on meaningful features instead of fitting to random variations.

ii. Feature Retention with Lossless Compression: Lossless compression maintains image integrity by preserving all pixel information, which allows the model to leverage subtle features that may contribute to higher accuracy. These finer details, essential in certain classification tasks, can make the model more robust, especially when distinguishing between similar classes.

iii. Data Efficiency and Model Focus: Both forms of compression contribute to a more efficient dataset by reducing file sizes, which can speed up data loading and processing times. More importantly, compressed images may help the model avoid becoming "distracted" by unnecessary details, thereby allowing it to focus on the most distinctive features for classification.

4.1 Practical Implications:
These findings suggest that preprocessing methods, including thoughtful compression choices, can play a critical role in CNN performance. For tasks requiring high classification accuracy and where fine-grained details matter, lossless compression may offer the best results. In contrast, lossy compression may be a suitable trade-off between performance and computational efficiency in situations where minor quality loss is acceptable.

This comparison underscores the importance of data preprocessing in optimizing model performance, and it demonstrates how specific image compression techniques can be leveraged to balance accuracy, efficiency, and dataset manageability.
